				"description": "This request retrieves the status and URLs of processed images associated with a specific job identified by the `jobId` query parameter.\n\n**HTTP Method:** GET\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `jobId` (Query Parameter): The unique identifier of the job for which you want to retrieve image statuses.\n    \n\n**Response:**\n\n- HTTP 200 OK: If the request is successful, it returns a JSON array containing image status and URLs.\n    \n- HTTP 400 Bad Request: If the `jobId` query parameter is missing or invalid.\n    \n- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error: If an error occurs while fetching image statuses.\n    \n\n**Usage:**\n\n1. Ensure that you have the necessary authorization and environment variables configured.\n    \n2. Send a GET request to this endpoint with the `jobId` query parameter to retrieve image statuses.\n    \n3. The response will contain information about each image's status and a URL for viewing the image.\n    \n\n**Notes:**\n\n- This function is part of the SSP Assignment project and relies on Azure Blob Storage and Azure Table Storage for storing image data and status information.\n    \n- The function also generates a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token to access the Blob Container securely."

			"name": "Enqueue Weather Job",
			"request": {
				"method": "GET",
				"header": [],
				"description": "This function is designed to enqueue a new job related to weather data processing. When triggered via HTTP `GET` or `POST`, it generates a unique job identifier, serializes the job details into a JSON string, and encodes this string into a Base64 format. The resulting message is then sent to an Azure Queue named as per the `jobid-queue-name` environment variable.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n- **Method:** GET\n- **Authorization:** Function key (provided in query parameter `code`)\n- **Query Parameter:** `code` - The function key for authorizing access to the function.\n- **Body:** None required for GET, no specific payload is expected as the job details are internally generated.\n    \n\n**Response:**  \nUpon successful execution, the function returns an HTTP 200 OK status with a message confirming that the job has been enqueued, including the unique `JobId`. The `JobId` can be used for tracking the processing of the job or correlating with subsequent related operations.\n\n**Sample Response:**\n\n``` json\njsonCopy code\"Enqueued weather job: <unique-jobId>\"\n\n ```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- This function is part of a larger system that processes weather data. The enqueued job will be picked up by a queue-triggered function for further processing.\n- Ensure the Azure Queue exists and that the function app has the necessary permissions to interact with it.\n- Use the returned `JobId` to query the status of the job from other components of the system if such functionality is provided."
